     <h2 style="text-align: left;"> Skills </h2>
                                  <div class="container"> <p>I think I have several skills that actually help me build myself and get to where I want to be. 
Number 1 is the mindset that I have. For me, having the right mindset everyday would help people to get their job done and be successful for whatever they do. I always set my mindset and my mentality right. If you would ask how I got that skill, well I think it’s because of my athletic background. Mindset is really important when you are an athlete because it dictates how you will perform. Kobe Bryant is a big influence in having my skills, Kobe is a big believer that with hard work, you will succeed. So, he studied all the details for him to be the greatest basketball player. Number 2 is the Strong work ethic. Just like Kobe, nobody became great at what they do if they didn’t work hard enough. Staying consistent is the key to all success, and that’s what I always tell myself.

                                  <div class="container"> <p>I have many hobbies that keep me engaged and happy. I love watching videos on youtube, tiktok, and other video entertainment platforms. Whenever I don’t have anything to do I would go open my phone and watch videos. I also love playing video games, it is what I really love to do, I couldn't finish my day without playing video games, that’s how I love doing it. And since I am also an athlete, working out is also one of my hobbies. I also love doing it because it lets me have a productive day. Learning new things is also one of my hobbies as well, I just love the thought of getting to learn something new everyday and it would actually let me realize the impact of it for my future. I love to experience something new too, like what they would always say, “you only live once”. I do maximize every time that I have to enjoy life as well as securing my future. My hobbies bring me joy, help me grow, and make life more enjoyable.
